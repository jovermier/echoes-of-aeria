## Project Standards

### Architecture Principles
- **Clean Separation**: Game logic (Phaser) and UI (React) are distinct
- **Event-Driven**: Systems communicate through typed events (`/src/shared/events.ts`)
- **Schema-First**: All data structures follow JSON Schema validation
- **Performance-First**: 60fps gameplay with <512MB memory usage
- **Standards Compliance**: Automated validation prevents integration issues
