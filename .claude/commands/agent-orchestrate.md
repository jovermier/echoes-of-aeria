# Agent Orchestrate Command

Coordinates multiple specialist agents for complex feature development.

## Usage
```
@agent-orchestrate <epic-name> <description>
```

## Examples
```
@agent-orchestrate "dialogue-system" "Implement branching dialogue trees with NPC interactions"
@agent-orchestrate "inventory-ui" "Create React-based inventory interface with drag-and-drop"
@agent-orchestrate "combat-overhaul" "Enhanced combat system with combos and special attacks"
```

## Agent Coordination Flow

### 1. Epic Planning
- **Orchestrator**: Breaks down epic into implementable tasks
- **Spec Librarian**: Defines data schemas and validation rules
- **Game Architect**: Creates system design and integration plan

### 2. Implementation Assignment
- **Combat & Physics Engineer**: Combat mechanics and player actions
- **UI/UX Designer**: React components and user interfaces
- **Audio Wiring**: Sound effects and music integration
- **World Builder**: Content creation and level design
- **Map/Streaming Engineer**: Runtime world management

### 3. Validation Checkpoints
- **Pre-Implementation**: Baseline capture and requirement documentation
- **Mid-Implementation**: Incremental validation and early issue detection
- **Pre-Integration**: Cross-system compatibility verification
- **Pre-Release**: Full regression suite and performance validation
- **Post-Deployment**: Continuous monitoring and health checks

### 4. Quality Assurance
- **Testing & QA**: Comprehensive testing across all phases
- **Visual Regression Tester**: Screenshot comparison and visual validation
- **Tilemap & Collision Validator**: Map asset integrity checking

## Autonomous Coordination
- **Task Dependencies**: Automatic dependency resolution and sequencing
- **Resource Balancing**: Intelligent task distribution across agents
- **Conflict Resolution**: Architectural decision facilitation
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time milestone monitoring
- **Issue Escalation**: Automated escalation rules and agent reassignment
