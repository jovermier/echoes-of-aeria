## Notes for Visual Comparison

1. **Critical Elements:** Focus comparison on player character, UI elements, and overall color palette transformation
2. **Performance:** Monitor that visual improvements don't negatively impact the stable 60 FPS
3. **Functionality:** Ensure all captured UI states remain functional after visual overhaul
4. **Consistency:** Verify that ALTTP visual style is applied consistently across all captured states

---

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation:** Begin ALTTP visual transformation
2. **Comparison:** Capture identical screenshots after changes
3. **Analysis:** Document visual improvements and any regressions
4. **Optimization:** Address any performance impacts from enhanced visuals
